# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Instructions to run
- npm install
- npm run dev

# Assumptions
- This contact app is aimed to be used by businesses, as I have chosen to display their professional headshot, working email, websites, phone numbers, and social media.
- As for responsiveness, the website works fine on desktop as it dynamically changes the number of contacts on a row. However, I didn't manage to get the website looks good on mobile phones.
